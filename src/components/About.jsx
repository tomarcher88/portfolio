      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Having spent the last two years embracing self-improvement and devoting
        myself to learning web development, I have built up an understanding of
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React, and a portfolio that demonstrates the
        skills and knowledge I have acquired over that time. I know how to fetch
        data from an API, build a React component and even centre a div; now I
        feel it's time for me to take the next step and start building a career
        along with my knowledge.
